# Data Mining

## PEC1
In this practice, the initial phases of a data mining project are tackled. The goal is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the dataset that will later serve as the foundation for model construction. Fundamental data handling tasks like feature selection, data preparation for algorithm consumption will be performed, and aim to extract as much knowledge as possible from the data.

#### Initial Data Handling
- The dataset is loaded, filtered, the initial structure is verified, and the description of the variables and their types is reviewed.
- Basic descriptive statistics are computed to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution.
- Attributes with empty values are handled, employing strategies such as imputation for continuous variables and substitution for categorical variables.
- Feature engineering: New fields are created, such as discretizing continuous variables into categorical bins using equal-width interval methods and k-means clustering.
- Variables are scaled to ensure that they contribute equally to the analysis, implementing normalization techniques to adjust the range of data values.

#### Visual Data Analysis
- Through the use of various plotting techniques, the relationships between different variables is explored to uncover patterns and insights.
- The search for correlations between variables is undertaken to inform the selection of features for the modeling phase. This involves statistical tests and the generation of correlation matrices.

#### Concluding Remarks
Based on the exploratory data analysis (EDA), there are drawn preliminary conclusions about the dataset's characteristics, the quality of the data, and any patterns that have emerged. These findings will guide the subsequent data mining processes.
